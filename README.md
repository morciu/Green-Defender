# Green-Defender

A silly side scrolling 2d arcade shooter created with Pygame.

## Premise

You are an little green man in a flying saucer in space. Asteroids are coming for you. You must deffend yourself by shooting them up. You are the... **Green Defender**.

## Background
I created this game while trying to learng to code during the pandemic. I was reading **Python Crash Course** by Eric Matthes and one of the projects in the book was to make a shooter using Pygame, after coding along to the version in the book I decided to create my own with different features from the original version in the book.

After a few months of struggling and googling trying to figure out how to get certain idea from my head to the python code I finished this game.
